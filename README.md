# Virtual 3d tour of the University Francisco de Paula Santander using Microsoft Kinect as an input device.
This App was designed and developed for my System Engineering bachelor's degree thesis.
The App was developed with Unity3D 4.5 and used Microsoft Kinect as an input device; it allowed users to navigate through the 3D tour using gestures captured by Kinect and interpreted by Zigfu, an open-source library to process motion capture using Microsoft Kinect technologies.

The app and thesis document awarded me an Honours degree and was used to start the first video games and interactive media research lab at the Universidad Francisco de Paula Santander.
